# Thank You!
Thank you for wanting to contribute to us! It means a lot to us! Now how do you contribute correctly to us?

#### Important note
Of course you shouldn't use code blocks or tables in your Pull Requests or Issues, this is just to simulate the environment in which you type your Pull Request or Issue.  
**We expect you to behave maturely and refrain from using harsh language, NSFW content. Anyone breaking the community guidelines of GitHub and/or ReMod Studios will be dealt with accordingly.**

### Pull Requests
To create a good PR is to create something that explains the changes you've made in a short but detailed way.
The things we **demand** from a Pull Request are:

A title that explains the changes you've made in as little words as possible without being vague. 
The best things to use as a title are:
* The name of the branch you created where the changes are made in (e.g. purple-mooshroom)
* Your Github username (e.g. GitHub_User69) 

The result will be:

`GitHub_User69 purple-mooshroom`

And as a description we **demand** a clear explanation of what you added and/or changed. For example:

```
Added purple mooshrooms to the mushroom caves and changed the neon mushroom's texture and gave it 
light emission of light-level 3. Got rid of the spawn rule for the mooshroom and added a new one.
```
Here we have some interesting references you might not understand when reading this since this is completely made up. Let me explain:
* The mushroom caves I was referring to is actually a custom biome added in the fictional project I am using as an example.
* The neon mushroom is also a fictional custom block that is added by this project.
* The spawn rule for the mooshroom is a .json file that controls how and where the mooshroom (and variants) spawn in your Minecraft world.

You should try to use as few words as you can while still keeping your intentions and message clear.

Next you should set the PR mode to Rebase and Merge

### Issues
There are two kinds of "Issues" you can submit.
* A bug report
* A suggestion

We will go over these individually.

#### Bug Reports
A bug report is not limited to just bugs. Errors, glitches, performance issues, clunky mechanics, rough and unpolished animations/behaviors (entities).

This works almost the same as Pull Requests:
| A title with your username and the type of fault |
:----:
| A description explaining when the fault occurs and how it affects your experience |

So that will look like:
| GitHub_User69, glitches |
:---
| When a purple mooshrrom is spawned in the texture is glitched. It causes the mushrooms on the back of the purple mooshroom to not appear correctly and thus not making it glow. |
---

#### Suggestions
A suggestion can be about almost anything related to the project. However formatting those is something you should do correctly *every single time* to avoid confusion with bug reports.
A small list of things you could submit a suggestion for:
- Suggestion for new biomes
- Suggestion for new mechanics
- Suggestion for new mob(s)
- Suggestion for new item(s)
- Suggestion for new block(s)

These are formatted like this:

| A title with your username and -SUGGESTION- |
| --- |
| A description explaining your concept in great detail with every feauture and/or behavior associated with it. You should also explain in depth why it should be added and why it isn't just another random feature. You should give some form of contact info in case we want to reach out to you. Don't share real info such as IP address, mobile phone number, private E-mail address or passwords & usernames to accounts. If you have Discord, giving username and tag will do perfectly. If you don't feel like sharing any contact info is that perfectly fine and won't be talked about ever again. Although we might not be able to reach out to you easily your privacy is more important than us. |
